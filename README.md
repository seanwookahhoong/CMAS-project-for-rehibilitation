This is the repository for the CMAS project.

## What is it?
Contactless Music Activating System(CMAS) is a series of musical games that is made for children and teenagers going through upper limb rehabilitation. 
## Our goal?
Make a more engaging rehabilitation process for the patient. This is because recovery of the patient is very dependent on the time taken to train the muscles. Thus, having a more engaging rehabilitation process is essential to make sure the patient heals quicky and completely as much as possible
## What software/hardware am I using?
You will be using unity to make the game, a leap motion controller
