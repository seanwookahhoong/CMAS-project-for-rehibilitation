# Week 0
I was briefed about the project and I learned that I am going to make games and improve on existing ones that my seniors have already made for my Final year project.
 I was also briefed of what things I will be using:
 * Unity 3D
 * Visual studio
 * MIDI Code(Music Generation)
  * Leap Motion Control(Input device)

For this week, I will do research and also meet with my seniors who have worked on the project before to make sure that I can get their vision for this project, which is necessary for its completion and excellence

### Senior meeting
I met my senior yesterday who worked on the project the last semester. He briefed me about the progess of the project and what I have to do. He told me that there were two games for the project. The first game was completed but second was not. Thus, my FYP for this semester is to fix the problems of the second game.
These are the problems:
* Glitches
	* The ball would glitch out of the game when hands are in the air(Ball doesn't respawn during this) --> probably caused by the hands and when they suddenly appear it creates space thus getting more and more

* Ball       
	* Bigger
	* Add weight

* General
	* Make the game more engaging
	* Make scoreboard have purpose
	* Add difficulty levels
	* Make ball easier to pick up
* Possible areas to explore
	* AR applications
	* AI intergration
	* 

He also taught me how to set up my computer for the project, here's how he did it
## Download procedure

#### Step 1: Download relevant software
First, go to [this website](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and download this version(Unity 2018.4.18). Download unity hub and download the version of unity.

Then, to go the [leap motion SDK webiste](https://developer.leapmotion.com/sdk-leap-motion-controller/) and download for you relevant OS system


#### Step 2: unzip file and install unity
Now, after you have dowloaded the SDK, now unzip it. Use 7-zip to do it or use winrar


# Week 1-2
I was tasked by my lecturer to do to two things 
1. To make a piano with 3-5 keys that plays a note in Midi code in about two weeks time, knowing my first ever task on this project. I went to research about how to make the piano.
2. Discuss with the other engineering rehibilitaion people how to make a rehibilitation course with our products

I have been busy with a project called TIP in the first week and thus I was able to work on the piano only in week two. Though I was able to discuss about the project with the ER(engineering rehibilitation) student about what direction to have our rehibiltaion course to go

## Engineering rehibilitation meeting
We met during the first week and we were discussing about how we could combine our ideas together here are the sildes we presented to our lecturers
he said that there needs to be 1-2 research papers/ newspaper articles to back up our data. Also the flowchart needs to be more detailed.
He also said to explain each of our project more.

## Piano making
Firstly, I watched this course called ["Learning C#"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-c-sharp-3/welcome?u=2122804) and learnt about the basics of C# and it is used to do scripting for making games
For a quicker tutorial, go to the [W3 schools C# tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/default.asp) to learn about the basics or C#


Then, used this [tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball) where I learnt the basics of unity and how it works.

After that, I watched this video that allowed me to make a [piano in unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkE1YSSdOLU).

Though I came into a problem, when i followed the video, I realised that 

# Week 3
## Engineering Rehibilitation meeting
We went to improve our slides, we put one or two research papers into the
