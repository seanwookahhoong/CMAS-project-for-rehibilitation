# DISCLAIMER
This is my reflection when doing this project so it is going to have my thoughts on what I felt about the project.
I will be splitting the progress report by weeks, then I will further split between my reflections and the actual how to-dos for future reference or future interns. I will be marking the how to-dos with **``(Tutorial)``** so you don't have to read the whole document

# Week 0
## Reflections
I was briefed about the project and I learned that I am going to make games and improve on existing ones that my seniors have already made for my Final year project.
 I was also briefed of what things I will be using:
 * Unity 3D
 * Visual studio
 * MIDI Code(Music Generation)
  * Leap Motion Control(Input device)

For this week, I will do research and also meet with my seniors who have worked on the project before to make sure that I can get their vision for this project, which is necessary for its completion and excellence

### Senior meeting
I met my senior yesterday who worked on the project the last semester. He briefed me about the progress of the project and what I have to do. He told me that there were two games for the project. The first game was completed but the second was not. Thus, my FYP for this semester is to fix the problems of the second game.
These are the problems:
* Glitches
	* The ball would glitch out of the game when hands are in the air(Ball doesn't respawn during this) --> probably caused by the hands and when they suddenly appear it creates space thus getting more and more

* Ball       
	* Bigger
	* Add weight

* General
	* Make the game more engaging
	* Make scoreboard have a purpose
	* Add difficulty levels
	* Make ball easier to pick up
* Possible areas to explore
	* AR applications
	* AI integration
	
### Download things ``(Tutorial)``
### Step 1: Download relevant software
First, go to [this website](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and download this version(Unity 2018.4.18). Download unity hub and download the version of unity.

Then, to go the [leap motion SDK webiste](https://developer.leapmotion.com/sdk-leap-motion-controller/) and download for you relevant OS system. You will now be able to use the leap motion controller for your project.
You also need to go to [this website](https://developer.leapmotion.com/unity) and install the required unity packages needed to create games in unity*

**You should put all of the leap motion controller stuff in one folder in your desktop for convenience purposes**

# Week 1-2
## Reflections
I was tasked by my lecturer to do two things 
1.  Discuss with the other engineering rehabilitation people how to make a rehabilitation course with our products
2. To make a piano with 3-5 keys that play a note in Midi code in about two weeks, knowing my first ever task on this project. I went to research about how to make the piano

I have been busy with a project called TIP in the first week and thus I was able to work on the piano only in week two. Though I was able to discuss the project with the ER(engineering rehabilitation) student about what direction to have our rehabilitation course to go

### 1.Engineering rehabilitation meeting
We met during the first week and we were discussing how we could combine our ideas here are the slides we presented to our lecturers
he said that there need to be 1-2 research papers/ newspaper articles to back up our data. Also, the flowchart needs to be more detailed.
He also said to explain each of our projects more.


### 2. Piano making ``(Tutorial)``
Firstly, I watched this course called ["Learning C#"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-c-sharp-3/welcome?u=2122804) and learnt about the basics of C# and it is used to do scripting for making games
For a quicker tutorial, go to the [W3 schools C# tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/default.asp) to learn about the basics or C#


Then, used this tutorial called [roll a ball](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball) where I learnt the basics of unity and how it works. Make sure you follow the tutorial that corresponds to the version of unity you are using

After that, I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkE1YSSdOLU) as reference for making the piano in unity

Though I came into a problem, when I followed the video, at 17:16, I was unable to drag the game object as he did.

# Week 3
## Reflection
### Engineering Rehibilitation meeting
We went to improve our slides, we put one or two research papers and did slide for each of our products. Mr Kumar, our lecturer saw our slides again and he said that there needs to be more explanation about the rehabilitation process and our slides need to convince doctors to take upon our prototypes
