# Week 0

This week I was briefed about the project and how we are going to be helping children and teens for their upper limb rehibilitation.

I learned about the things I am going to be using for the project:
* Unity 3D
* MIDI code(for music generation)
* Visual studio
* Leap motion control(Input movement device)
