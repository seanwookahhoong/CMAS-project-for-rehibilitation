## This is my FYP project, an continuation of the project: Contactless Music Activating System(CMAS) for rehabilitation.

### Purpose
To have engaging rehabilitation approach for patients namely children and teenagers undergoing upper limb rehabilitation, 

CMAS aims to be an additional supplementary program  in the rehabilitation regimen. Utilizing the advancements of technology and music therapy, CMAS is a series of musical games that aims to give a fulfilling and engaging experience to patients.  The known benefits of music when coupled with the advancement of technology in the  medical field can prove to be significantly beneficial in the process of rehabilitation. This in turn indicates the suitability of such a system to provide an engaging experience to patients who may find the rehabilitation process to be difficult, hence easing the tedious process.
